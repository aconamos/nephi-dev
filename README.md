Homepage!

Here's the code for the homepage. It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build), a Static Site Generator that's _blazingly fast_. The static pages are then served using _nginx_ on a server I own.

It also uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) because it makes me feel cool and keeps me out of stylesheet soup. I use stylesheets everywhere anyways. Sigh.
